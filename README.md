# Qualified Object Notation (QON)

Notation to describe object data (for storage and transport).


Goals:

* Simple and easy to read.
* Efficient to parse and process.
* Allow typed objects.


This notation is a tradeoff between XML/XSD and JSON/JsonSchema.


The projects in this repository describe the syntax and contains a parser built with Xtext.
